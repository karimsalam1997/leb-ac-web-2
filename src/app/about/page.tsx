              The word <em>academic</em> in our name does not mean the
              footnoted neutrality of the journal article. It means
              <em> structural</em>. We are interested in the load-bearing
              walls, not the wallpaper. In the system, not the scandal. In
              the incentive that produces the headline, not the headline
              itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bias of most writing on Lebanon is to mistake the surface
              for the country — to treat each new crisis as an unrelated
              episode rather than as the predictable output of a machine
              that has been running since 1943. We treat it as a machine.
              We describe how the machine works. We name the parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are non-partisan in the sense that we do not write
              ammunition for any sect or party. We are not neutral in any
              other sense. We have a clear position: Lebanon&rsquo;s
              dysfunction is not the result of bad luck or a wounded
              culture. It is the result of a small number of structural
              choices, made by identifiable people, in service of an
              arrangement that benefits identifiable interests. Naming
              those choices is the first small act of repair.

              You will not find takes here. You will find the slow work of
              naming what is actually going on, in the longest form an

              <strong>Essays</strong> — long pieces (1,500&ndash;4,000
              words) that take a single load-bearing question and follow
              it to the floor. Most live in political economy, sect, and
              memory; some live in geography, language, and ritual. We
              publish across these because they are the same subject
              looked at from different angles.

              Lebanese Academic was founded in 2025, in the long shadow of
              1975. The year is in our masthead because every Lebanese
              political question still routes through the war that
              didn&rsquo;t end so much as change clothes.
